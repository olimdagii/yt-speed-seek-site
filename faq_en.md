# FAQ (EN)

## Default speed is not applied
- YouTube may reset playbackRate during early load.
- The extension enforces your default speed during the first few seconds and on first metadata load. If issues persist, try disabling conflicting extensions or reloading the tab.

## The top-left speed indicator does not appear
- On some Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi/Opera), the native indicator may not appear due to YouTubeâ€™s internal behavior or A/B experiments. Speed is applied even if no indicator appears.

## Shortcuts do not work
- Make sure focus is not inside an input/textarea.
- Confirm the site is youtube.com or m.youtube.com.
- Check the Options page for your key bindings.

## Can I change the default keys?
- Yes. Open Options and modify the shortcuts (single letters).

## Data collection / Privacy
- No analytics, no external requests, no personal data collection.

## Permissions
- `storage` for saving options; `tabs` to deliver commands to the active tab.

## Mobile site support
- m.youtube.com is supported on desktop browsers. Mobile browsers may have limitations around shortcuts.
